## Ğ1nkgo Privacy Policy

Ğ1nkgo allows users to upload a card name (and in a future version, a card avatar) as part of their Cesium+ profile.

### Cesium+ Profile Privacy Policy

- **Public Data**: Both card names and avatars are public data. By uploading these, users accept their public visibility.
- **Data Storage**: These data are securely stored on [Cesium+ nodes](https://github.com/duniter/cesium-plus-pod).
- **User Control Over Their Data**: Users have the right to delete their card name and, in the future, their avatar from the same page where they are set up.
- **Data Usage**: We do not use card names or avatars for purposes other than display on the Cesium+ profile. They are not shared or used for analysis, marketing, or any other commercial purpose.

By using Ğ1nkgo and creating a profile on Cesium+, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy, and agree to the collection, use, and processing of your personal data as described herein.
