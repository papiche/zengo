  "faq_1_title": "Can I import my Cesium account?",
  "faq_1_desc": "Yes, you can import a Cessium account and it will ask for your password/passphrase on each use.",
  "faq_2_title": "Is this wallet secure?",
  "faq_2_desc": "It is as secure as carrying a wallet or purse in your pocket. In other words, you use a regular bank card by taking it out of your pocket and entering a four-digit password. With this Ğ1 wallet, it's pretty much the same thing. You take out your phone, unlock it typically with a four-digit PIN, and then you can operate this wallet. Therefore, you should be just as cautious as you are with your physical wallets and purses. If you delete this browser or app or lose your mobile device, you may lose your funds and not be able to recover them (unless you have an exported backup copy of your wallet).",
  "faq_3_title": "Why can't I add a password to the wallet?",
  "faq_3_desc": "First, adding nuclear suitcase-level security to a wallet of this type is a hassle. Second, people lose their passwords and funds all the time, which we wanted to avoid. Finally, although we could add something simpler like a PIN password or a pattern, people might repeat their mobile or credit card passwords, which could be disastrous. We believe it is safer this way.",
  "faq_4_title": "Why use something as literal as a credit card and a card reader?",
  "faq_4_desc": "Mainly, because we wanted to make the use of Ğ1 simple for new people, and then, with use, make it easier to transition to using more advanced programs like Cesium.",
